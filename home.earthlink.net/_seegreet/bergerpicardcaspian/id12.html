                                    in the USA - Julie Daniels!!!&nbsp;She is just SUPER!!! Cassie loves her and got to spend some time with her at her place
                                    while we were on vacation in December/January. He is coming along well and we expect to register for our first agility run
                                    later this Spring. Have also decided that Cassie will be retiring from being a stud dog. We are following a protocol which
                                    hopefully will help keep the Berger Picard gene pool healthy here in the USA. When too many of one line gets into the gene
                                    pool you can end up with what is known as the "Popular Sire Syndrome". Being that the Picard gene pool is still very small
                                    we need to make sure we do all that we can to diversify while maintaining all the good qualities. Cassie has had 19 beautiful,
                                    healthy puppies with outstanding temperaments. He has achieved the 5% requisite of having his line carried on. BIG Congratulations
                                    Caspian!!! One of Caspian's daughter's, (Izanne Aria de la Vie en Rose) was&nbsp;recently on a local television station. On&nbsp;youtube

                                    did this by placing multiple times in first place against other breeds and also by competing against his own breed and finishing

                                    ring and do not wish to embarrass ourselves too much although this is all for fun! =) Cassie also attended a wonderful "Because
                                    of Winn-Dixie" party at the local elementary school fourth grade.&nbsp;Around 100&nbsp;children ages 9-11&nbsp;years&nbsp;and
                                    Cassie had a wonderful time meeting and greeting each other. We were invited again for next year and every year thereafter!

                                    test is done to verify there is no hip dysplasia. Although we make sure every test is passed on both sides, there is, as of
                                    yet, no way to be 100% due to the environmental factor that is part of the health equation.&nbsp;Thank goodness Picards are
                                    blessed with such a few number of health issues and the ability of the internet that&nbsp;gives us all the ability to find
                                    wonderful responsible folks who care about their Picards and love them as much as we do our boy to make sure their dogs are

                                    the big news from the end of August was the personal invitation to Quebec from our last show. The judge said Caspian was "Just
                                    beautiful!" and she would really like us to come up Quebec where she can judge him with the other Picards up there as she
                                    has judged them before. What a compliment! There is one in September next year with judges from France I believe. So that
                                    is the plan for next year by the latest. Also we are getting Caspian registered with the CKC (Canadian Kennel Club) so that
                                    we may show him in Canada at the various CKC shows. Caspian's next trip will be this coming October at the first annual meeting
                                    the club will have as the AKC parent club. Am so excited about seeing all the wonderful Picards that will be there and the
                                    many folks we know and love!</div><div dir="ltr"><strong><u></u></strong>&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr"><strong><u>Feb </u></strong></div>

                                    sure)! That's two out of two wins for him! Congratulations Cassie! Just found out we could get our pictures taken with the
                                    judge. I had thought the photos were only for the regular group wins. Hopefully next show we will get one of the 'official
                                    judge with ribbon' photos to put here. We also received many compliments and inquires about puppies. It almost seemed like
                                    the NYC Meet the Breed event =) The next show we will be able to attend will not be until April. But this is ok as Pepe (our
                                    handling instructor) said since this is all new for Cassie we should take things a bit slow not risk him being burned out.
                                    I am so grateful to have wonderful advice from&nbsp;him and all the new friends we have made at our last two shows. Thank
                                    you so much to everyone! And Congratulations again Cassie!!</div>

                                    been practicing since mid November attending handling class. We ended up taking a break in December because of a family vacation
                                    and I had some sugery, then got the flu. None of that was planned but ready or not AKC here we come!</div>
                                    <div dir="ltr">Our first show was the second weekend in January where I took Cassie in&nbsp;and got&nbsp;Best in Miscellaneous
                                    (BIM)! We are going to our next show the first weekend in February! Our class instructor Pepe Anastas and his wife Liz have
                                    been so nice and helpful with advice and wonderful instruction. They let us use one of their crates while at the show and
                                    there were plenty of folks who had helpful advice that I have taken to heart and we have been trying to implement. Our very
                                    first judge was Peter Green. He liked Cassie and was great with some constructive critiscism when I asked him. It was really
                                    good to watch some of the other dogs. Also made a new friend that has a Belgium Sheepdog named SETI. All in all we had fun
                                    and cannot wait to go to our next show! Good luck Cassie!</div>

                                    his therapy dog certification from TDI! Cassie also attended last November 2011, the big AKC Meet the Breeds event in NYC.
                                    I am pleased to say that even after 9 straight hours with no breaks of meeting every kind of person imaginable, Cassie was
                                    still giving hello kisses to all the children and adults who asked he saw. I was amazed! This was the first time he was around
                                    so many different people in a very unusual for him place. I was so proud! He was invited and will be attending again the NYC
                                    AKC Meet the Breeds&nbsp;this year on October 20th and 21st! Cassie is still attending classes regularly and we are currently
                                    working on teaching him some tricks for the nursing home. There are updated photos of his two boys of Gaston <a href="id40.html"><font  color="black""><font color="#003399">here</font></font></a>,&nbsp;and Gille <a href="id41.html"><font  color="black""><font color="#003399">here</font></font></a>. Cassie also has a Facebook page dedicated to him <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eloreannae.eloreanna" target="_blank"><font  color="black""><font color="#003399">here</font></font></a>. Cassie also has had his heart OFA certified "Normal" <a href="id38.html"><font  color="black""><font color="#003399">here</font></font></a> as apparently there can be some Picards with heart issues. Cassie also got his CHIC number and certificate <a href="id42.html"><font  color="black""><font color="#003399">here</font></font></a>. Cassie also has a new playmate&nbsp;locally, in NH!! Beau!

                                    weekend, Cassie started and finished earning his UKC Conformation Champion title! We had a wonderful time! He even had a group
                                    of admirers whistling and cheering him on during our final event. It made our whole first show experience unforgettable! We
                                    learned so much, and again have some idea of how much&nbsp;I <em>know</em> I do not know. One of the most important things&nbsp;I
                                    still have to learn is where in the group line up we should be (no one seemed to have any idea, and we almost ran into the
                                    dogs in front of us a couple of times).&nbsp;I would have never thought&nbsp;about tearing the ends of the armband to get
                                    the elastic band to stay on (because mine kept falling off)! Or that I really need to get a dressy pair of <em>real</em> running
                                    shoes so that the judge can see how Cassie gates without being held back (because I kept feeling like my shoe was going to
                                    fall off my foot). I had absolutely no idea that Cassie prefers day old warm cheese to fresh roast beef as bait when he always
                                    prefers roast beef at home (that was a lucky find)!&nbsp;Cassie should also not ever have a hose down during the evening before
                                    the show&nbsp;(his fur gets funny looking cowlicks as it dries from sleeping); the list can go on and on (it all looks so
                                    easy on the TV, you tube,&nbsp;and was very different while we were practicing).&nbsp;I cannot imagine what it would have
                                    been like if we had not been practicing or attending Conformation class (well actually I could I think, but its not a pretty
                                    thought)!&nbsp;It seems like in so many other aspects&nbsp;of&nbsp;life, there is nothing like just getting in there and experiencing
                                    things first hand. So I think we&nbsp;most certainly will keep&nbsp;going to shows when we get the opportunity.&nbsp;It was
                                    a lot of fun, and exciting, and we really really enjoyed the learning process! I feel that Cassie and I actually know each
                                    other better too! There were so many folks who were just wonderfully helpful and nice (actually, I do not think we could have
                                    done what we did without their help and advice). I want to especially thank, for a great number of reasons and help, Marsha
                                    and her menagerie =)&nbsp;Her Briard, Slipper is one of the most beautiful dogs I have <em>ever</em> seen. We also found out
                                    that&nbsp;she and Marsha were at the specialty in Kentucky last September (where we were too)! Slipper received an award of

                                    that they look good and healthy, and will continue to be so after they are born. Will keep updating here as events unfold.

                                    <div dir="ltr">There is a mixture of news this month. Sadly, the litter of four puppies that Whistle was due to give birth
                                    to all passed away and were buried on Monday, the eleventh. The veterinarian thinks that Whistle had uterine inertia, (where
                                    the cervix opened but there were no contractions to push the pups out). There were three beautiful boys and one precious girl.
                                    They were buried next to a creek under the branches of a willow tree. It is comforting to know that mommy Whistle is doing
                                    okay.</div>

                                    <div dir="ltr">Of positive news this past month: Cassie was bred last month to a beautiful brindle UKC champion, Coco Chanel.
                                    Chanel was evaluated at last year's elevage by Mr. J. C. Larive as "Excellent" and in the notes he had written that she is
                                    of the older style of Picard. She has a wonderful temperment and is a great mommy dog. Their puppies are scheduled to arrive
                                    sometime during the beginning of May. Will keep you updated.</div>

                                    <div dir="ltr">Cassie also had his first off day during one of our conformation classes. He just could not be still and focus.
                                    Everything was a distraction that he just could not miss wanting to investigate. We have begun to try to practice outside
                                    of class a little. He was back on track during his next class. I will be keeping my fingers crossed that the two days we have
                                    our show will be two good focus days for him and we will continue to work at home in addition to continuing&nbsp;our two conformation
                                    classes a week.

                                    <div dir="ltr"><strong>Mom: </strong>February is full of some very big news! Firstly, Cassie was bred to a lovely southern
                                    belle! Her name is Da'Bomb of Double D Ranch, aka "Whistle". Whistle is a very accomplished young lady! She is a UCA (lure
                                    coarsing title), UWP Champion. She also does dock diving, and weight pulling, as well as being invited to participate in the
                                    top 10 UKC Premier last year (her papa won first place). Their puppies are scheduled to arrive this April 9th. More about

Cassie also joined a very <a href="http://www.nashuadog.org/about.html" target="_blank"><font  color="black""><font color="#003399">large and happy doggie playgroup</font></font></a>&nbsp;(there are over 100 dogs that attend)! They meet every Sunday for two hours. Cassie just loves it there! There are plenty
                                    of photos on the playgroups website. It is so nice to be able to be with so many different friendly off leash dogs in&nbsp;an
                                    immaculate space.&nbsp;=) Cassie is also doing very well in his conformation classes. I am thinking we should be certainly
                                    ready by April's show time!</div>

                                    <div dir="ltr"><strong>Mom:</strong> Well, its been a busy two months! Where to start: In December, Cassie began a new activity
                                    that the kids and family can enjoy with him, without us being in the sub zero temps via video recording.&nbsp;Cassie got to
                                    go hiking in the wild blue yonder of New Hampshire off-lead with a very determined woman,&nbsp;and her pack of dogs. He was
                                    coming home so dirty! With such a satisfied look to him. How wonderful! And we got to see him and the dogs in action on the
                                    movie made without getting cold! (A real bonus when your little ones are just&nbsp;two and three years old). We just hosed
                                    him off when he got home and then he'd pass out for most of the rest of the day! We were also busy with the holidays and vacationing.
                                    This month we have been recovering and&nbsp;have started&nbsp;getting Cassie ready for a UKC show coming this April. Caspian's

                                    to help us out with something. Also, I got to be in a show and well, that was just ok, but mum seems to have had fun so that
                                    is good! Mum said we got a pretty blue ribbon and that made my mum real happy. I sure do hope that we can go again sometime

                                    how much we still do not know! We&nbsp;met some really beautiful Berger Picards and&nbsp;the really wonderful people who are
